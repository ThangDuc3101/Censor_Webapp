# Censor_Webapp
---
## Description
#### The CENSOR application is a web-based implementation of a video censoring tool. It utilizes the main tools such as Mediapipe and Flask. The application functions by taking input in the form of a video (either a .mp4 file or real-time frames from a webcam), detecting faces or hands, and subsequently blurring or censoring them.
